# ConcertPub Svelte[kit] project

Hi! This is my first front-end project; I'm trying the framework Svelte and SvelteKit after few years of backend-only development.

## Improvements
- Use a SQLite/etc instead of ts files for database (avoided for now)
- Use only webp for food images (avoided for now)

## Develop
To start a development server:
```sh
npm run dev
```

## Build
To create a production version:
```sh
npm run build
```

## Deploy
The adapter is Node since the project is deployed on Railway.<br>
It's live at [pub.concertplan.com](https://pub.concertplan.com).
